                <p><strong>The "No Excuses" Mindset: Operationalizing Resilience</strong></p>
                <p>Xavier Sanchez was born with a rare congenital disability, but his resilience wasn’t built in
                    isolation. It was shaped in environments that prioritized adaptation, beginning in early inclusive
                    care programs where he first learned the "Figure It Out" mindset.
                    <br><br>
                    In this keynote, Xavier shares a practical approach to overcoming adversity. Whether it’s "bridging
                    the gap" socially or tackling the technical challenge of 3D-printing a steering wheel for his custom
                    van (as seen on <em>Built For Business</em>), Xavier illustrates how constraints can become
                    catalysts for tech startups and corporate teams alike.

            <div class="topic-content">
                <p><strong>The "Figure It Out" Framework for Accessibility</strong></p>
                <p>True inclusion isn't just about meeting ADA requirements. It is about fostering a culture of
                    adaptation. Xavier Sanchez learned this at age two at Respite Care of San Antonio, where the
                    philosophy was simple: if a space doesn't work for you, we figure it out together.
                    <br><br>
                    Xavier moves the DEI conversation from "awareness" to "actionable advocacy." He challenges leaders
                    to look at their organizations through the "Figure It Out" lens, asking not just "is this
                    compliant?" but "is this adaptive?" He shares how removing the social awkwardness around disability
                    leads to stronger, more honest, and more innovative teams.

                <p><strong>Adaptive Leadership: Managing Projects (and People) Without a Playbook</strong></p>
                <p>How do you lead a team or manage a project when the standard operating procedures don't apply
                    to you? Xavier Sanchez has spent his career successfully managing complex operations—from
                    scaling fintech processes at Revolut to managing high-stakes client relationships at Cruising
                    Kitchens.
                    <br><br>
                    In this session, Xavier combines his corporate project management experience with his background
                    coaching youth at the Believe It Foundation. He demonstrates that the best leaders act like
                    "translators," bridging the disconnect between rigid goals and human realities. Perfect for
                    managers needing to build teams that are resilient by design.
